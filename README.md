It leverages the power of Next.js for a fast, server-rendered React application and a robust Node.js backend to handle business logic and data management.

## ✨ Features

While the project is under development, the planned core features include:

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and login functionality.
*   **Course Management:** Create, update, and manage courses and their content.
*   **Interactive Lessons:** View and interact with course materials.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Monitor user progress through courses and lessons.
*   **Responsive Design:** A clean and accessible UI that works on all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for the Web.

### Running the Application

You will need to run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
